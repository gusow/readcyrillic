This is a very simple [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project I threw together in an hour or so to help learn how to read and pronounce cyrillic. Helped me a lot with geoguessr! Feel free to contribute, suggest improvements, or build on it.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
